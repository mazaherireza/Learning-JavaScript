Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all DECLARATIONS to the top of the current scope
(to the top of the current script or the current function)

VARIABLES defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the BLOCK, but not initialized.
Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.
