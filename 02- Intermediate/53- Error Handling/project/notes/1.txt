JavaScript try...catch...finally
--------------------------------
When an error occurs, JavaScript will stop and generate an error message.
(JavaScript throws and exception)

JavaScript creates and Error object with 2 properties: name and message. <---------- ***

The try...catch...finally handles errors WITHOUT stopping JavaScript. <-------------- ***

The try statement defines the code block to run (to try).
The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.
The finally statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result. <--------------- ***

The throw statement defines a custome error. <--------------- ***

Both catch and finally are optional, but you MUST use one of them.

Using throw with try and catch, lets you control program flow and generate custom error messages.
