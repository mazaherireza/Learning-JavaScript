Asynchronous JavaScript
-----------------------
"I will finish later!"

Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous. <------------ ***
... JavaScript setTimeout()

... callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions.

Instead of passing the name of a function as an argument to another function,
you can always pass a whole function instead.

With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, 
and continue running other tasks in parallel.
