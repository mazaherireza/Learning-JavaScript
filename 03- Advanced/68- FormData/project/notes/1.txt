FormData
--------
The FormData interface provides a way to construct a set of key/value pairs 
representing form fields and their values <------------------- * 
, which can be sent using the fetch(), ...
...
You can also pass it directly to the URLSearchParams constructor ...

FormData() <---------------- Creates a new FormData object

Guard
-----
Since headers can be sent in requests and received in responses, 
and have various limitations about what information can and should be mutable,
headers' objects have a guard property. 
This is not exposed to the Web, but it affects which mutation operations are allowed on the headers object.
...
Both requests and responses may contain body data. 

for await...of
--------------
The for await...of statement creates a loop iterating over async iterable objects as well as sync iterables. 

This statement can only be used in contexts where await can be used, 
which includes inside an async function body and in a module.
