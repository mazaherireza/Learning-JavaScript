HTTP 
----
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol 
that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, 
typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them. 

As part of a URI, the "http" within "http://example.com/" is called a "scheme". 
Resources using the "http" schema are typically transported over unencrypted connections using the HTTP protocol.

The "https" scheme (as in "https://developer.mozilla.org") 
indicates that a resource is transported using the HTTP protocol, 
but over a secure TLS channel. <-------------- ***

HTTP is textual (all communication is done in plain text) and stateless 
(no communication is aware of previous communications). 
This property makes it ideal for humans to read documents (websites) on the world wide web.
