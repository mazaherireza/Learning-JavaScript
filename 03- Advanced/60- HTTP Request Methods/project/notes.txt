HTTP Request Methods
--------------------
What is HTTP?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

... a client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server,then the server returns a response to the client. 
The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

HTTP Methods
------------
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
CONNECT
TRACE

The GET Method
--------------
GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
... the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:

/test/demo_form.php?firstName=Reza&lastName=Mazaheri

GET requests can be cached
... remain in the browser history
... can be bookmarked
... should NEVER be used when dealing with sensitive data
... have length restrictions
... are only used to request data (not modify)

The POST Method
---------------
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
The data sent to the server with POST, is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: <------- ***

POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com

firstName=Reza&lastName=Mazaheri

POST requests are NEVER cached <--------------- *
... do not remain in the browser history
... cannot be bookmarked
... have no restrictions on data length

The PUT Method
--------------
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. <----------- *
That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. 
In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

The HEAD Method
---------------
HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. <----------- ***

In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, 
then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.

A HEAD request is useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - 
a HEAD request can read the Content-Length header to check the size of the file, 
without actually downloading the file.

The DELETE Method
-----------------
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

The PATCH Method
----------------
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

The OPTIONS Method
------------------
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

The CONNECT Method
------------------
The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with the requested resource.

The TRACE Method
----------------
The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that tests the path for the target resource 
(useful for debugging purposes).
