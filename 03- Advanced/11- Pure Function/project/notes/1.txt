Pure Functions in JavaScript
----------------------------
... is a function (a block of code) that ALWAYS returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution.
Rather, it only depends on its input arguments. <--------------- **

.. a pure function, does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests or data mutation, etc.

Note: If a pure function calls a pure function, this isn't a side effect, 
and the calling function is still considered pure.

Some Side effects ...

Printing to a screen or console
