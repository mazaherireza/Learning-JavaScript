XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
--------------------------------
XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data. <---------- ***
Was designed to store and transport data.

XML does not do anything.
XML is just information wrapped in tags.

The Difference Between XML and HTML
---------------------------------- 
XML was designed to carry data with focus on WHAT data is.
HTML was designed to display data with focus on HOW data looks.
XML tags are NOT predefined like HTML tags are. <------------------ **
  
The XML language has no predefined tags.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

XML is Extensible
-----------------
... note.xml
...
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, ...

** Extensible:
(IT) 
Used to describe a computer program or language that can be changed by the people
who use it in order to make it suitable for what they need to do.
