Spread Operator
---------------
The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or 
part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

... is often used in combination with destructuring.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;
