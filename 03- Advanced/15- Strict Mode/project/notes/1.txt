JavaScript Use Strict
---------------------
"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a strict or a function.

... makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

The "this" keyword in functions behaves differently in strict mode.
The "this" keyword refers to the object that called the function.
If the object is not specified, function in strict mode will return "undefined"
and functions in normal mode will return the global object (window).

The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
