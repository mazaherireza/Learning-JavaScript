How do I start to design my website?
------------------------------------
... the all-important first step of every project: 
define what you want to accomplish with it.

..., but what really matters is what you want to accomplish.

What exactly do I want to accomplish?
How will a website help me reach my goals?
What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

Deeper dive
-----------
A project never starts with the technical side.
Technique comes second.

... you must first step back and decide in detail what you want to do.

An hour's discussoin with friends is a good start, ...

What exactly do I want to accomplish?

... list all the goals you want to reach.

Once you have such a list, you need to prioritize.
Order the goals from most important to least important.

How could a website bring me to my goals?

What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

... it's time to turn those goals into acctionable steps.

Conclusion
..., the simple idea "I want to make a website" generates a long to-do list, 
which only grows longer as you can think about it.
