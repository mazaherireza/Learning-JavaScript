JavaScript Callbacks
--------------------
"I will call back later!"

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
This technique allows a function to call another function. <-------------- **

Sometimes you would like to have better control over WHEN to execute a function.

When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use ().

Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions,
where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).
