npx
---
Run a command from a local or remote npm package

This command allows you to run an arbitrary command from an npm package,
in a similar context as running it via npm run.

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a sepcific package and try out some commands.
But you cannot do that without instaling the dependencies in your local node_modules folder
