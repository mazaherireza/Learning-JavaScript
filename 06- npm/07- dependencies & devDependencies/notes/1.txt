Specifying dependencies and devDependencies in a package.json file 
------------------------------------------------------------------
To specify the packages your project depends on, 
you MUST list them as "dependencies" or "devDependencies" in your package's package.json file. 

When you (or another user) run npm install, 
npm will download dependencies and devDependencies that are listed in package.json 
that meet the semantic version requirements listed for each.

"dependencies": Packages required by your application in PRODUCTION.
"devDependencies": Packages that are ONLY needed for local development and testing.

To add dependencies and devDependencies to a package.json file from the command line, 
you can install them in the root directory of your package using the --save-prod flag for dependencies 
(the default behavior of npm install) or the --save-dev flag for devDependencies.

To add an entry to the "devDependencies" attribute of a package.json file, 
on the command line, run the following command:

npm install <package-name> --save-dev
----------------------------------
... not for the application to run in production.
Some common examples of such packages are testing frameworks, code linters (prettier, eslint),
build tools (babel, webpack), ...

$ npm i jest --save-dev
