
  An install event is always the first one sent to a service worker 
  (this can be used to start the  process of populating an IndexedDB, and caching site assets)
  During this step, the application is preparing to make everything available for use offline.


  The skipWaiting() method of the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope interface, forces the waiting service worker 
  to become the active service worker.

  ... newly installed service worker, receives an activate event.
  The primary use of activate is to clean up resources used in previous versions of the service worker.
  The new service worker can call skipWaiting() to ask to be activated immediately 
  without waiting for open pages to be closed.
  ...

  ... is fired in the service worker's global scope, when the main app thread, makes a network request. 
  It enables the service worker to intercept  network requests and send customized responses
  (for example, from a local cache)

  ---------------------------------------
  Cache
  The Cache interface provides a persistent storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs 
  that are cached in long lived memory.
  How long a Cache object lives is browser dependent, ...
  ...
  Use CacheStorage.open() to open a specific named Cache object and 
  then call any of the Cache methods to maintain the Cache.
  
  Instance methods
  ...
  Cache.add(request)
