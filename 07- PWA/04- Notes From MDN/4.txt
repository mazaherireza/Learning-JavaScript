Secure Connection
-----------------
PWAs can only be installed using a manifest file when served with the https:// protocol, 
or when served locally from 127.0.0.1 and localhost URLs with the http:// protocol.

Viewing with the file:// protocol
---------------------------------
... which provides a secure context. 
This ensures that the pages can be viewed with the current state of our codebase, <-------------------- **
and will continue to work as we add JavaScript functionality that requires a secure context.

Serving your app over https isn't only good for PWAs, but for all websites as it ensures 
the information that transits between your web server and the user's browser is encrypted end to end. <----------- ***

While we can view and test most application functionality using the file:// protocol, 
we can't use it to test application installation using our manifest file. <---------------- **

localhost
---------
The default method for setting up a local development environment varies by OS.

localhost with a port number
----------------------------
...

Localhost with npx
------------------
If you have node installed, you may have npm and npx installed as well. <---------------------- *
At the command line, enter npx -v. 
If a version number is returned, you can use http-server, a non-configurable static HTTP server, 
without needing to install any requirements. 
Enter npx http-server [path] at the command line, where [path] is the folder where your index file is stored.

By default, entering localhost:8080 in the browser URL bar will load the page. <-------------- *
If you already started a server at port 8080, it will automatically change the port number, 
starting the developer environment using an available port, such at 8081.

...
Entering npx http-server /user/yourName/CycleTracker -p 8787 will start local server at port 8787 if available.
If not, if you enter a port number that is already being used, you will get an "address already in use" or similar error.
...
This non-configurable static HTTP server suffices for our basic app. <-------------- **
Apps served via localhost and 127.0.0.1 are exempt from https and always considered secure. 

npm install -g local-web-server
cd ~/user/yourName/CycleTracker/
ws --https

In the above, you may need to prefix the install with sudo.

Secure external server
---------------------
..., you'll want to have your content hosted and available on a secure remote server.

GitHub Pages
