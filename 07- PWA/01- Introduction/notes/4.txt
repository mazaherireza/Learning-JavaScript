Making PWAs installable
-----------------------
One of the defining aspects of a PWA is that it can be promoted by the browser for installation on the device. 
Once installed, a PWA appears to users as a platform-specific app, 
a permanent feature of their device which they can launch directly from the operating system like any other app.

We can summarize this as follows:

Supporting browsers promote the PWA to the user for installation on the device.
The PWA can be installed like a platform-specific app, and can customize the install process.
Once installed, the PWA gets an app icon on the device, alongside platform-specific apps.
Once installed, the PWA can be launched as a standalone app, rather than a website in a browser.

Installability

The web app manifest
--------------------
A web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser how the PWA should appear and behave on the device. 
For a web app to be a PWA it must be installable, and for it to be installable it must include a manifest.

The manifest is included using a <link> element in the app's HTML.

If the PWA has more than one page, every page must reference the manifest in this way.

The manifest contains a single JSON object containing a collection of members, 
each of which defines some aspect of the PWA's appearance or behavior. 
Here's a rather minimal manifest, containing just two members: "name" and "icons".

{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icons/512.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512"
    }
  ]
}

Required manifest members
-------------------------
Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome, Samsung Internet, and Microsoft Edge, 
require that the manifest includes the following members:

name or short_name
icons must contain a 192px and a 512px icon
start_url
display and/or display_override
prefer-related-application must be false or not present

HTTPS, localhost, or loopback are required
------------------------------------------
For a PWA to be installable it must be served using the https protocol, 
or from a local development environment using localhost or 127.0.0.1 â€” with or without a port number.
