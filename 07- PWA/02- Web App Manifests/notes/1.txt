Web app manifests
-----------------
A web application manifest, ... , is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.

The most common use for a web application manifest is to provide information that 
the browser needs to install a progressive web app (PWA) on a device, such as the app's name and icon.

A web application manifest contains a single JSON object where the top-level keys are called members.

Members
-------
This section lists the members that may appear in the manifest.

All members are optional in the specification, but some applications require some members to be present. 
For example, PWAs must provide certain manifest members.

background_color
categories
description
display
display_override
file_handlers

prefer_related_applications

Deploying a manifest
--------------------
Web app manifests are deployed in your HTML pages using a <link> element in the <head> of a document:

<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />

Splash screens
--------------
In some browsers and operating systems, a splash screen is displayed when an installed PWA is launched. 
This splash screen is automatically generated and its appearance is defined by members in the web app manifest, specifically:

name
background_color
icons
