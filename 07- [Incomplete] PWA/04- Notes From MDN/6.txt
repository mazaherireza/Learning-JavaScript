Manifest and iconography
------------------------
A PWA manifest file, is a JSON file that provides information about the features of that app 
to make it look and behave like a native app when installed on the user's device. 
The manifest contains metadata for your app, including its name, icons, and presentational directives.

..., all of the manifest keys, or members, are optional, some browsers, operating systems, 
and app distributors have require specific members for a web app to be a PWA.

App identity
------------
To identify your PWA, the JSON must include a name or short_name member, or both, to define the PWA name. 
It can also include a description.

short_name
The name of the PWA displayed to the user if there isn't enough space to display the name.	

description
Explanation of what the application does.

App presentation
----------------
...
start_url
The start page when a user launches the PWA.

display
... minimal-ui, which is similar to a standalone view but with UI elements for controlling navigation, ...

Colors
------
theme_color
The default color of OS and browser UI elements such as the status bar on some mobile experiences ...

background_color
A placeholder color to be displayed as the background of the app until the CSS is loaded. 
To create a smooth transition between app launch and load, 
it is recommended to use the <color> declared as the app's background-color color. <------------------ **

...
In our CSS, the background-color: #efe; is set on the body element selector. 
We use #eeffee to ensure a smooth transition from placeholder appearance to app load.

{
  ...
  "theme_color": "#eeffee",
  "background_color": "#eeffee",
...
}

App iconography <------------------------ 
---------------
PWA icons, help users identify your app, make it more visually appealing, and improve discoverability.

The size of the rendered icon and the file requirements varies depending on where it is displayed and by whom. <--------- **
The manifest is where you define your images.

... the icons member, specifies an array of one or more icon objects for use in different contexts, ...
... src, ... sizes ... and optional type and purpose ...
The safe zone, the area that will render okay if the icon is masked as a circle, is the inner 80% of the image file. 
Icons are labeled as safe to be masked, by the "purpose" ..., when set to "maskable", defines the icon as adaptive.

Adding the manifest to the app
------------------------------
...
The manifest file extension can be ... .webappmanifest. 
However, being a JSON file, it is most commonly saved with the browser-supported .json extension.
...
With a manifest file and when loaded from an https:// URL (or localhost), 
most browsers will recognize your site as a PWA and some will prompt to install it.
