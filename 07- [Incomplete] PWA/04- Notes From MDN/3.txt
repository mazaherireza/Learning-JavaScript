Base HTML and CSS
-----------------
To build a PWA, we need to create a fully-functioning web application. 
... we will markup the HTML for a static web page and enhance the appearance with CSS.

Static web content
------------------
...
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</body>

HTML content
------------
...
The HTML's first line is a doctype preamble, which ensures the content behaves correctly.

The root <html> tags wrap all the content with the lang attribute defining the primary language of the page.

Document head
-------------
The <head> contains machine-readable information about the web application that's not visible to readers except for the <title>, 
which is displayed as the heading of the browser tab.

The <head> includes all the meta data. <---------------- *

The first two bits of information in your <head> should always be the character set definition, which defines the character encoding, 
and the viewport <meta> tag, which ensures the page renders at the width of the viewport and isn't shrunken down when loaded on very small screens.

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
</head>

...
While the contents of the <head> are not displayed within the page, the contents of the <title> are seen!
The <title> element's inner text appears in the browser tab when the page is loaded, in search engine results, 
and is the default title used when a user bookmarks a web page. <--------------- *
The title also provides an accessible name for screen reader users who depend on it to know which tab they're currently on.

... we opted for a shortened name that is more discreet.

While officially optional, for better user experience, <-------------------- *
these two <meta> tags and the <title> are the three components of the <head> 
that should be considered required components of any HTML document.

The HTML <link> element is used to specify a relationship between the current document and an external resource. 
... rel="stylesheet", imports an external resource as a stylesheet.

Document body
-------------
The <body> element contains all the content we want displayed when users visit the site on the Internet.

... a level-1 heading using an <h1> ...

... we include a <fieldset> with a <legend> labeling the purpose of that set of form fields.
...
The type="submit" is optional, as submit is the default type for <button>.

Temporary hard-coded results text
---------------------------------
...

JavaScript link
---------------
...
We include the defer attribute to defer the loading of this script and ensure the JavaScript is executed 
after the document's HTML has been parsed.

CSS content
-----------
...  
irrelevant styles, like the list-style-type declaration on legend, are ignored.
...

li,
legend {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0.2em 0.5em;
  background-color: #cfc;
}
